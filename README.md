# Study of Recommender Systems

This is a final project for  DS5230 (Unsupervised Machine Learning).

We implement the following techniques to create a Movie Recommender System:

1. Content-Based Recommendation
2. Collaborative Filtering (using Scikit-Surprise)
3. Neural Collaborative Filtering
4. Variational Autoencoders
5. Recommendation using K-Means on Spark.

A detailed report is also included in the repo.
